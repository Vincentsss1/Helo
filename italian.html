Studying Italian literature offers students a deep appreciation for Italyâ€™s cultural identity and its influence</br>
 on European and world literature. It teaches them not only about significant literary figures but also how literature</br>
  can be a lens through which to understand broader societal changes, such as shifts in political ideologies, social norms,</br>
   and philosophical thought.</p>
